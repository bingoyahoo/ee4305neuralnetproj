# Introduction


This is the project for NUS EE4305 (Fuzzy Neural Networks) for AY16/17 S1. 

For this project, we are given both a classification problem (multi-class) involving HAPT features and a regression problem involving Student Performance. By the way, classification is a problem whereby we are interested to find out which category does a new row of test data belong to. On the other hand, regression is a problem which we try to approximate the relationships among variables.

## How To Run The Code
To run my python scripts, use Python 2.7 and

1. Open a terminal console
2. Cd into `TASK1` or `TASK2` folder
3. Type `python classification.py` or `python regression.py` respectively and press enter

## Dependencies to Install
__Please Note:__ There are some python dependencies to install (recommended to use `pip`):


1. `Keras` - A high-level neural network and deep-learning library that supports fast creation and training of of a NN model.

2. `TensorFlow` - An open-source library developed by Google for numerical computation of data flow graphs. Keras runs on top of TensorFlow (OSX). Alternatively, Theano can be used for Windows users.

3. `Pandas` - An open-source Python library providing data structures and data manipulation functions which I used to parse and manipulate the given .txt and .xls input files in the dataset.

4. `Scikit-learn` - A Python library for Machine Learning. It is used internally by Keras and requires NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

5. `Numpy` - a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

6. `Scipy` - an open source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing.

7. `Matplotlib` - matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
